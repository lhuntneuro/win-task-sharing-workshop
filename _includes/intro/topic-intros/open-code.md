WIN is committed to developing an open science community with a positive culture for sharing data, tasks, tools and protocols. A key part of this is training up WIN members to be able to share effectively.

This training will focus on **task sharing** at WIN. It will teach researchers to:
* use the WIN **GitLab** as a platform for hosting your tasks, and either sharing them publicly or just within WIN
* create their first **repository** that contains their task, add a **license** and make a simple **readme**
* understand the main **motivations** for sharing tasks, and address any concerns they may have about task sharing

_This workshop was developed using a template designed by the UK reproducibility network (UKRN).

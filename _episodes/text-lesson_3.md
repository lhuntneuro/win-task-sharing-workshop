teaching: 0
exercises: 40
duration: null
summary: Finish making your repositories, adding more detail to readme, add license
questions: null
objectives:
  - By the end of this section, you should have completed making your first
    repository, added a readme file/license, and shared it online
keypoints:
  - The readme file is very important for new researchers who may not be
    familiar with your experiment
  - Try sending a link to your repository to another researcher in your group,
    and seeing if they can get the experiment up and running on their computer
    without any further input from you
  - You are encouraged to make the repository "public", so that other
    researchers around the world can see your work. However, you can also make
    the repository "internal" (only visible within WIN) or "private" (only
    visible to you) if you wish

## Welcome to the WIN Paradigm Sharing workshop!
> In today's workshop, we're going to introduce you to the <a href="https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science">GitLab</a> and Pavlovia repositories for sharing your paradigms in WIN. We will then each try to create our own repositories!
>
The principles of the workshop are as follows:
- No homework for busy people! We want you to have the opportunity to create your first repository as part of the workshop, without needing to put in additional work.
- All abilities welcome! You're welome to attend whether you've never touched git before, or if you're a git power-user

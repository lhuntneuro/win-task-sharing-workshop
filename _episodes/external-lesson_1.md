## Welcome to the WIN Paradigm Sharing workshop!
> In today's workshop, we're going to introduce you to the <a href="https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science">GitLab</a> and Pavlovia repositories for sharing your paradigms in WIN. We will then each try to create our own repositories!

**The principles of the workshop are as follows:**
- No homework for busy people! We want you to have the opportunity to create your first repository as part of the workshop, without needing to put in additional work.
- All abilities welcome! You're welome to attend whether you've never touched git before, or if you're a git power-user

**The schedule of today's workshop is:**
- 10 mins: *Welcome and introductions* (what we're doing right now!)
- 15 mins: *Why share your tasks?* A brief discussion on why task sharing is a good idea, and how to get started at WIN
- 25 mins: *Live demo!* A walkthrough, from start to finish, of setting up a repository on the WIN Gitlab server
- 40 mins: *Make your own repository (part 1)* - start to create a simple repository for your task, put a copy of the current version of your task in the repository, and make a simple readme file
- 10 mins: Break
- 15 mins: *Live demo!* How to add a license to your repository, and make it citable using Zenodo
- 40 mins: *Make your own repository (part 2)* - finish making your repositories, adding more detail to readme, add license
- 25 mins: *Wrap up* - everyone briefly says what they've made, and we address any final questions

## Icebreaker time!
As this is an online workshop, we'd like everyone in the room to say:
- Their name
- Which group/department they're working in
- What kind of task they're planning on sharing
- What they wanted to be when they were 11 years old
